# Assignment 1: Making Shoes

I made a pair of Japanese [Geta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geta_(footwear)), largely because I was quite limited on time and this particular kind of shoe would be much easier than other types of footwear to fabricate under a tight schedule. This is for the following reasons

- Apart from the fabric thong, the shoe is made of a single rigid body.
- The geometry of the rigid body is blocky and amenable to quick prototyping.
- The geometry of the rigid body can be fabricated by the _stacking method_ using a laser cutter.

Because my research thinks about how makers can better understand the constraints of various fabrication machines and workflows, I was interested in understanding my own thought process here.
My first priority was thinking _how can I fabricate this really quicky?_ The fastest machine to iterate on is the laser cutter, and geta seemed like a good choice for that.
This is interesting: rather than think about what I want to make, I proritize how to make itâ€”the machine influences the product.
The next problem I faced is that it would be difficult to create boxes via fabricating the sides, because then I would have think about joinery and material thicknesses from multiple angles.
Because I also needed the shoes to be sturdy, I decided to create volumes by stacking sheet materials via vertical slicing.
Once I had figured out this approach, only then did I go to CAD software, and to the makerspace.
